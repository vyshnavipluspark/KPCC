                    The national freedom movement significantly influenced the
                    political history of Kerala. Here, an echo of the Salt
                    Satyagraha was heard. The entrance of lower castes into the
                    Vaikom temple via a Satyagraha was acknowledged as a direct
                    challenge to the rulers' and, by extension, the British
                    occupation's prevailing political and hierarchical
                    supremacy. In addition to Gandhiji's physical presence,
                    numerous Congress-led people's movements contributed to the
                    Kerala national movement against the British. As a result of
                    their leadership in various political movements opposing
                    British rule, Congress ultimately transformed the freedom
                    struggle in the state into a struggle for the rights of the
                    state's people, particularly millions of impoverished and
                    marginalized individuals, which had been violated.

                    Since ancient times, the British Supremacy's ruthless
                    exploitation and dominance sparked countless rebellions; by
                    the turn of the 19th century, the enraged multitudes were
                    attempting to emancipate themselves from the burden of
                    British dominance. The Congress Party was a prominent
                    advocate for accountability and resistance against the
                    heinous acts committed by the Briti sh regime within the
                    state. The Congress party was extremely outspoken during
                    that era in opposition to prevalent social inequities,
                    including untouchability and social isolation.

                  <p class="text-start">
                    The Congress movement began to spread throughout India
                    towards the close of the 19th century. Numerous notable
                    individuals were affiliated with the Indian National
                    Congress from Kerala. Sir, G.P. Pillai. Included among them
                    were C. Sankaran Nair and Rairu Nambiar. C. The inaugural
                    Malayali to preside over congress sessions for an extended
                    period of time was Sankaran Nair, a native of Ottapalam. In
                    the year 1897, he assumed the presidency of the Amaravathi
                    Session of the Congress. In Malabar, Congress activities
                    acquired momentum by 1919. The influence of Gandhiji on the
                    state congress grew during the 1920s. The Khilafat movement,
                    Salt Satyagraha, and noncooperation in Malabar sparked the
                    nation's pride. Among the early pioneers of the Malabar
                    liberation movement were K. K.P. Kesava Menon, Muhamed
                    Abdurahiman Kelappan, and K. Nair, Madhavan.

                  <p class="text-start">
                    This national movement was propelled by Mahatma Gandhi, who
                    also exerted an extraordinary impact on the state's
                    liberation struggle. The inferior social classes were
                    regarded as untouchables and were not permitted to traverse
                    even the roads leading to temples in Kerala. The backward
                    social strata gained access to the public roads adjacent to
                    the Vaikom temple through the nonviolent Guruvayoor
                    Satyagraha movement and the Vaikom Satyagraha movement, both
                    of which were led by Gandhiji. Sree Chithira Thirunal
                    Balaramavarma Maharaja, the sovereign of Thiruvithamkur,
                    issued the Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936, permitting
                    individuals of all castes to enter this temple.

                    The British implemented stringent regulations on salt
                    production and levied high taxes on the country's citizens
                    in 1930. Under the leadership of K., this infuriated the
                    populace of Kerala and the entire nation. Salt was produced

                    Salt laws were violated in numerous locations, with

                    resulting in the apprehension of hundreds of agitators.

                    The character of the freedom movement in Thiruvithamkur was
                    notably dissimilar. The influence of caste organizations in
                    Thiruvithamkur was significant. Within the city limits,
                    these organizations advocated for social equity and the
                    adequate representation of disadvantaged segments of the
                    population in government positions and the legislature. In
                    addition, the Travancore State Congress was established,
                    with notable leaders including T.K. Madhavan, T.M. Varghese,
                    C. Kesavan, and Pattam Thanupilla. Its members fought for
                    the rights of the state's populace that had been violated
                    during British rule. Significant influencers in the
                    formation of Prajamandalam were Ikkanda Warrier and
                    Panampilly Govinda Menon, both of whom were born in Cochin.

                    The Malabar District was not devoid of adherents of the Home
                    Rule Movement. Sri. Secretary of both the Congress Committee
                    and the Home Rule League was K.P. Kesava Menon. His
                    political activities galvanized the entire Malabar district.
                    In Malabar, the national movement experienced a surge in
                    support and influence during the First World War.
                    Concurrently, the Muslim populace of Malabar was incensed by
                    the Khilafat movement. The Malabar rebellion of 1921 stood
                    as the most significant occurrence associated with the
                    political movement in Malabar to this time. 61 of the 90
                    Mapillas who were being transported as captives in a closed
                    railway goods wagon from Tirur to Coimbatore perished of
                    suffocation during the "Wagon Tragedy," one of the tragic
                    events associated with this rebellion. The insurrection of
                    1921 constituted a significant national unrest that
                    challenged the authority of the British.

                    The Congress personnel appeared to have been dormant in the

                    other Congress employees, including K. P. Kesava Menon,
                    established the Mathrubhumi, a Malayalam daily based in
                    Calicut, with the intention of disseminating the Congress's
                    message. The Salt Satyagraha, which commenced in 1930 under
                    the guidance of Gandhiji, also influenced the state of
                    Kerala. The Salt Sathyagraha in Malabar primarily took place
                    in Payyannur. Long after this, Malabar eventually emerged as
                    the focal point of nationwide movements in Kerala.

                    The British government regarded the Congress as a
                    "illegitimate organization" during the Second Phase of the
                    Civil Disobedience Movement in 1932. The participation of
                    thousands of men and women in the agitation in Malabar
                    rendered the government's threats futile. The withdrawal of
                    the Civil Disobedience Movement was followed by a schism in
                    the Congress Party viz. including both leftists and
                    rightists. The Communist Party of Malabar was established in
                    1939 from the Congress party's radical faction. They
                    abandoned the Gandhian Principles after being inspired by
                    the Russian Revolution. However, they opposed the foreign
                    government in solidarity with the Congress.

                    subsequent to its liberation in August 1947, Malabar
                    remained an administrative region of the Madras state. The
                    Madras Legislature was augmented by four seats won by the
                    Congress Party of Malabar in the general election of 1951.

                    During the early British colonial period, the princely
                    states of Travancore and Cochin engaged in internal
                    conflicts and demonstrations to advocate for the rights of
                    their respective populations. The initial agitations were
                    directed toward the implementation of effective governance.
                    Subsequently, an ongoing resistance emerged in pursuit of
                    political rights, encompassing the representation and
                    participation of individuals at every level of government.

                    in Bombay on December 28, 1885. Travancore had a modest
                    representation in the early years of Congress formation at
                    the national level. Barrister G.P Pillai established the
                    Malayalee Memorial in 1891 to advocate for the rights of
                    locals in government service. The Congress convention held
                    in Amaravati was presided over by Shri. C. Sankaran Nair in
                    1897. A branch of the Congress was established in Trivandrum
                    in 1929, and the party unit's secretary was Barrister A.K
                    Pillai. In the same year that the KPCC was established in
                    Ottapalam, Later in 1921, Riverdrum also established a
                    congress committee.

                    Travancore was immediately affected by the civil
                    disobedience movements that Gandhiji initiated in 1920. The
                    state's Congress Committee coordinated demonstrations,
                    processions, and a boycott of British products. Travancore
                    experienced one of its most turbulent political unrest
                    periods in its history during the early 1930s. Commencing as
                    a form of resistance against the constitutional reforms
                    implemented in 1932, the Nivarthana movement emerged. The
                    agitation ultimately resulted in success, notwithstanding
                    the repressive measures implemented by the government.
                    Precise deliberations were conducted regarding each
                    community in response to the agitation.

                    The Travancore State Congress was established in 1938.

                    State Congress also included notable figures such as
                    Kesavan, P. K. Kunju, and T.M. Varghese. The objective of
                    the nascent organization was to secure a government that was
                    entirely accountable to the citizens of Travancore.In
                    Travancore, the Quit India Movement failed to elicit any
                    violent opposition. However, the political landscape of
                    Travancore became overshadowed by ominous clouds during the
                    postwar era. The proposal for constitutional reforms put
                    forth by Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer in January 1946 included
                    the establishment of an irrevocable executive branch,
                    inspired by the "American model." The State Congress deemed
                    the proposal to be unlawful and rejected it.

                    A sequence of extraordinary occurrences that transpired
                    between 1946 and 1947 came to a dramatic conclusion with the
                    establishment of responsible government in Travancore. When
                    did Sir begin in July 1947? C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer declared
                    that Travancore would attain independence on the date of the
                    British withdrawal from India. Both within and without the
                    state, the Diwan's proclamation sparked considerable
                    controversy. The ineffectual application of force by the
                    government in response to the statewide mass movement
                    spearheaded by the Congress party was evident. After the
                    Diwan was assaulted, he departed Travancore and tendered his
                    resignation from office. The state's quest for accountable
                    governance concluded triumphantly with the conclusion of
                    that conflict. Pattom Thanu Pillai, T. M. Varghese, and C.
                    T. established the first well-known ministry in Travancore.

                    The national freedom movement significantly influenced the
                    political history of Kerala. Here, an echo of the Salt

                    Vaikom temple via a Satyagraha was acknowledged as a direct

                    the Chief Minister. The ministry tendered its resignation on
                    September 10, 1964. Kerala State once more came under the

                    the Sankar Ministry. The Marxist Communist Party's division
                    within the Communist Party was the most significant

                    All political parties, including Congress, ran independently
                    in the 1965 midterm elections, lacking any electoral
                    alliance. Thus, in the new legislature, none of the parties
                    received a clear majority of representatives. President's
                    Rule was instituted in Kerala on March 24, 1965, subsequent
                    to the dissolution of the recently elected Legislative
                    Assembly.
